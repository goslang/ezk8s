Easy to use, schemaless Golang-Kubernetes client.

### Why This Project?

While it's true that Kubernetes has an official Go client, well... It's really big. Trying
to navigate all of it's documentation involves extensive googling, huge generated godocs, and
allot of browser tabs. If you're just trying to do something simple, the whole prospect can
be very daunting.

It's just an HTTP API, right? It shouldn't be that hard.

### Project Status

This Project is functional, but still under active development.
